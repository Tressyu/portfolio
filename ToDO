1. About me page content info:
Hey! I’m Tressyu — a self-driven learner with a passion for technology, creativity, and continuous growth. I spend a lot of my time learning to code, whether that’s through building small projects, exploring new languages, or just figuring out how things work behind the scenes.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me gaming, watching YouTube, or diving into random topics that catch my interest. I’m naturally curious and always looking for new skills to pick up or ideas to explore.

This site is where I share my journey — from coding projects to thoughts, experiments, and things I find cool along the way. Thanks for stopping by!
