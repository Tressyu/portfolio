        <p>Hey! I’m Tressyu.<br>
        I’m a self-driven learner with a passion for technology, creativity, and continuous growth.<br>
        I spend a lot of my time learning to code, whether that’s through building small projects, exploring new languages, or just figuring out how things work behind the scenes.<br> 
        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me gaming, watching YouTube, or diving into random topics that catch my interest. <br>
        <br> 
        This site is where I share my journey — from coding projects to thoughts, experiments, and things I find cool along the way. <br> 
        <br> 
        Thanks for stopping by!<br>
